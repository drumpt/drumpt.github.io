I am a **machine learning researcher** at [**AITRICS**](http://en.aitrics.com/?redirect=no), a healthcare AI startup in Korea, under Prof. [**Eunho Yang**](https://mli.kaist.ac.kr/people/)'s supervision. I completed my **Master's degree** in **Artificial Intelligence** at [**KAIST**](https://kaist.ac.kr/en/) under Prof. Eunho Yang as well and hold a **Bachelor's degree** in **Computer Science** and **Mathematics** from KAIST.

I am open to **research collaborations** globally and intend to pursue **doctoral studies** beginning **Fall 2026**. Should my research interests align with your work, I would be pleased to discuss potential collaborations.

**Research Interests:**
* Trustworthy Machine Learning
* Deep Generative Models
* Machine Learning Theory

My research aims to build **trustworthy machine learning systems** for real-world deployment through **robust deep generative models**, **theoretically grounded algorithms**, and **rigorous analysis** rooted in **machine learning theory**.

I address key challenges in **trustworthy ML**—**out-of-distribution generalization**, **explainability**, and **uncertainty calibration**—that span diverse modalities such as vision, vision-language, speech, tabular data, and time series.

Looking ahead, I plan to develop **trustworthy generative models** and **theoretical frameworks** for AI, focusing on **generalization error bounds** and **principled algorithm design**.

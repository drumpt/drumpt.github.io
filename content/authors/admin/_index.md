I am a **machine learning researcher** at [**AITRICS**](http://en.aitrics.com/?redirect=no), a healthcare AI startup in Korea, under Professor [**Eunho Yang**](https://mli.kaist.ac.kr/people/)'s supervision. I completed my **Master's degree** in **Artificial Intelligence** at [**KAIST**](https://kaist.ac.kr/en/) under Professor Yang and hold a **Bachelor's degree** in **Computer Science** and **Mathematics** from KAIST.

I am open to **research collaborations** globally and intend to pursue **doctoral studies** beginning **Fall 2026**. Should my research interests align with your work, I would be pleased to discuss potential collaborations.

My research focuses on developing **trustworthy machine learning systems** for reliable deployment through **robust deep generative models**, **algorithms with strong empirical and theoretical foundations**, and **theoretical analysis** with **machine learning theory**.

**Research Interests:**
* Trustworthy Machine Learning
* Deep Generative Models
* Machine Learning Theory

My research has explored **trustworthy machine learning** across domains including 3D point clouds, speech recognition, and time series: **out-of-distribution generalization**, **explainability**, and **uncertainty calibration**.

Moving forward, I aim to develop **trustworthy deep generative models** and **theoretical frameworks** for AI systems, particularly **generalization error bounds**, through **theoretically grounded algorithms** and **rigorous theoretical analyses**.

I am a **machine learning researcher** at [AITRICS](http://en.aitrics.com/?redirect=no), a healthcare AI startup in South Korea, where I am completing my **alternative military service** working with Prof. [Eunho Yang](https://mli.kaist.ac.kr/people/). Before joining AITRICS, I earned my master’s degree in **artificial intelligence** from [KAIST](https://www.kaist.ac.kr/kr/) where I was fortunate to be guided by Prof. Eunho Yang. I also completed my bachelor’s degree in **computer science** and **mathematics** at KAIST.

My long-term research goal is to **enhance the out-of-distribution generalization capability of machine learning models, thereby creating trustworthy AI systems that can be reliably deployed in new environments**. This goal is multidimensional, encompassing ensuring robustness under data distribution shifts (**domain adaptation and generalization**), handling unseen labels (**zero-shot learning**), and managing unseen tasks (**meta-learning**). To this end, during my master’s program, I focused on **test-time adaptation to distribution shifts across various tasks**, such as 3D point cloud classification, zero-shot classification of vision-language models, automatic speech recognition, and tabular/time series classification. These experiences also **enabled myself to adapt quickly to new modalities and tasks, leading to my interest in multimodal learning**.

Currently, at AITRICS, my research primarily aims to **enhance the generalizability of early prediction models for severe diseases**. I am also interested in **parameter- and data-efficient adaptation of foundation models**, such as **diffusion models** and **multimodal large language models**, to downstream tasks. To achieve these goals, I focus on **developing practical algorithms that are either empirically well-motivated or theoretically provable**. Additionally, I am deeply interested in **providing theoretical insights into machine learning models** through the lens of probabilistic (**Bayesian inference**) and statistical (**generalization bounds**) frameworks.

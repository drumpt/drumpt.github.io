I am a **machine learning researcher** at [**AITRICS**](http://en.aitrics.com/?redirect=no), a healthcare AI startup in Korea, where I am fulfilling my **alternative military service** under the supervision of Professor [**Eunho Yang**](https://mli.kaist.ac.kr/people/). Prior to joining AITRICS, I completed my **Master's degree** in **Artificial Intelligence** at [**KAIST**](https://kaist.ac.kr/en/), also under Professor Yang's guidance. Additionally, I hold a **Bachelor's degree** in **Computer Science** and **Mathematics** from KAIST.

My research has focused on the essential dimensions of **trustworthy machine learning**, explored across various application domains including 3D point cloud classification, automatic speech recognition, tabular learning, and time series analysis:
- **Out-of-distribution generalization**
- **Explainability**
- **Uncertainty calibration**

As I progress in my academic and research journey, I am particularly drawn to the development of **trustworthy deep generative models** and the **theoretical frameworks** that can demystify artificial intelligence systems, especially in terms of **generalizaion error bounds**. My long-term research vision aims to establish truly trustworthy machine learning systems through two complementary approaches:
- **Designing empirically well-motivated and theoretically grounded practical algorithms**
- **Conducting rigorous theoretical analyses of empirical machine learning techniques**

I am open to **research collaborations** on a global scale and intend to pursue **doctoral studies** beginning in **Fall 2026**. Remote collaboration opportunities are welcome. Should my research interests align with your work, I would be pleased to discuss potential collaborations.

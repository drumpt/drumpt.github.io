I am a **machine learning researcher** at [AITRICS](http://en.aitrics.com/?redirect=no), a healthcare AI startup in Korea, where I am fulfilling my **alternative military service** under Prof. [Eunho Yang](https://mli.kaist.ac.kr/people/). Before joining AITRICS, I obtained my master’s degree in **Artificial Intelligence** from [KAIST](https://kaist.ac.kr/en/), also under the guidance of Prof. Eunho Yang. I also completed my bachelor’s degree in **Computer Science** and **Mathematics** at KAIST. I am open to **research collaborations globally, including remote opportunities**. If you are interested in my work, please feel free to reach out!

My long-term research objective is to **enhance the out-of-distribution generalization capability of machine learning models, thereby creating trustworthy AI systems that can be reliably deployed in new environments**. This multifaceted goal involves ensuring robustness to distribution shifts (**domain adaptation and generalization**), handling unseen labels (**zero-shot learning**), and managing unseen tasks (**cross-task generalization**). During my master’s program, I focused on **test-time adaptation to distribution shifts across various tasks**, including 3D point cloud recognition, zero-shot transfer of vision-language models, automatic speech recognition, tabular learning, and time series classification. These experiences have also **enabled me to adapt to new modalities and tasks quickly**.

At AITRICS, my research centers on **improving the generalizability, robustness, and explainability of early prediction models for critical clinical outcomes** such as cardiac arrests and in-hospital mortality. I am also interested in **parameter- and data-efficient adaptation of deep generative models**, such as **diffusion models** and **large multimodal models**, to downstream tasks. To achieve these goals, I work on **developing practical algorithms that are empirically well-grounded or theoretically provable**. Additionally, I am passionate about **providing theoretical insights into machine learning models** through the lens of probabilistic (**Bayesian inference**) and statistical (**generalization bounds**) frameworks.

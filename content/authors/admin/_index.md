I am a machine learning researcher at [AITRICS](http://en.aitrics.com/?redirect=no), a healthcare AI startup in South Korea under the supervision of Prof. [Eunho Yang](https://mli.kaist.ac.kr/people/). My long-term research goal is to **improve and guarantee the out-of-distribution generalization capability of machine learning models, thereby creating trustworthy AI systems that can reliably adapt to new environments**. This involves ensuring robustness under data distribution shifts (**domain adaptation and generalization**), handling unseen labels (**open-set recognition**), and managing unseen tasks (**zero-shot learning** and **meta-learning**).

To this end, in my master's program, I have concentrated on **test-time adaptation to data distribution shifts in various tasks**, including 3D point cloud classification, zero-shot classification of vision-language models, automatic speech recognition, and tabular/time series classification. These works led to a **quick adaptation to different modalities** and **sparked my interest in multi-modal learning**.

Currently, my research primarily aims at **enhancing the generalizability of early prediction models for severe diseases**. I am also interested in **parameter- and data-efficient adaptation of foundation models**, such as **diffusion models** and **multi-modal large language models**, to downstream tasks.

For this, I am keen on **developing practical algorithms** that are either **empirically well-motivated** or **theoretically provable**. Furthermore, I am deeply interested in providing **theoretical insights into machine learning models** through the lens of probabilistic (**Bayesian inference**) and statistical (**generalization bounds**) frameworks.

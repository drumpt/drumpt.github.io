I completed my bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and Mathematical Sciences at KAIST as well. I am open to research collaborations globally, including remote opportunities. If you are interested in my work, please feel free to reach out!\nMy long-term research objective is to enhance the out-of-distribution generalization capability of machine learning models, thereby creating trustworthy AI systems that can be reliably deployed in new environments. This multifaceted goal involves ensuring robustness to distribution shifts (domain adaptation and generalization), handling unseen labels (zero-shot learning), and managing unseen tasks (cross-task generalization). During my master’s program, I focused on test-time adaptation to distribution shifts across various tasks, including 3D point cloud recognition, zero-shot transfer of vision-language models, automatic speech recognition, tabular learning, and time series classification. These experiences have also enabled myself to quickly adapt to new modalities and tasks.\nAt AITRICS, my research centers on improving the generalizability, robustness, and explainability of early prediction models for critical clinical outcomes such as cardiac arrests and in-hospital mortality. I am also interested in parameter- and data-efficient adaptation of deep generative models, such as diffusion models and large multimodal models, to downstream tasks. To achieve these goals, I work on developing practical algorithms that are empirically well-grounded or theoretically provable. Additionally, I am passionate about providing theoretical insights into machine learning models through the lens of probabilistic (Bayesian inference) and statistical (generalization bounds) frameworks.\n","date":1727913600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":1727913600,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"","section":"authors","summary":"I am a machine learning researcher at AITRICS, a healthcare AI startup in Korea, where I am fulfilling my alternative military service under Prof. Eunho Yang.

While several approaches have been proposed, they often exhibit high sensitivity to either the quantity or the quality of target speech samples. To address these limitations, we introduce Stable-TTS, a novel speaker-adaptive TTS framework that leverages a small subset of a high-quality pre-training dataset, referred to as prior samples. Specifically, Stable-TTS achieves prosody consistency by leveraging the high-quality prosody of prior samples, while effectively capturing the timbre of the target speaker. Additionally, it employs a prior-preservation loss during fine-tuning to maintain the synthesis ability for prior samples to prevent overfitting on target samples. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of Stable-TTS even under limited target speech samples.","tags":[],"title":"Stable-TTS: Stable Speaker-Adaptive Text-to-Speech Synthesis via Prosody Prompting","type":"publications"},{"authors":["Changhun Kim","Taewon Kim","Seungyeon Woo","June Yong Yang","Eunho Yang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1727654400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1727654400,"objectID":"abb5b18c608bbdbfe3bdd4f91b48e141","permalink":"https://drumpt.github.io/publications/adaptable/","publishdate":"1998-03-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publications/adaptable/","section":"publications","summary":"In real-world scenarios, tabular data often suffer from distribution shifts that threaten the performance of machine learning models. Despite its prevalence and importance, handling distribution shifts in the tabular domain remains underexplored due to the inherent challenges within the tabular data itself. In this sense, test-time adaptation (TTA) offers a promising solution by adapting models to target data without accessing source data, crucial for privacy-sensitive tabular domains. However, existing TTA methods either 1) overlook the nature of tabular distribution shifts, often involving label distribution shifts, or 2) impose architectural constraints on the model, leading to a lack of applicability. To this end, we propose AdapTable, a novel TTA framework for tabular data. AdapTable operates in two stages: 1) calibrating model predictions using a shift-aware uncertainty calibrator, and 2) adjusting these predictions to match the target label distribution with a label distribution handler. We validate the effectiveness of AdapTable through theoretical analysis and extensive experiments on various distribution shift scenarios. Our results demonstrate AdapTable's ability to handle various real-world distribution shifts, achieving up to a 16% improvement on the HELOC dataset.","tags":[],"title":"AdapTable: Test-Time Adaptation for Tabular Data via Shift-Aware Uncertainty Calibrator and Label Distribution Handler","type":"publications"},{"authors":["Hajin Shim","Changhun Kim","Eunho Yang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1727568e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1727568e3,"objectID":"7add84aed3f8bf1a927e65c01337caa6","permalink":"https://drumpt.github.io/publications/cloudfixer/","publishdate":"1998-03-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publications/cloudfixer/","section":"publications","summary":"3D point clouds captured from real-world sensors frequently encompass noisy points due to various obstacles, such as occlusion, limited resolution, and variations in scale. These challenges hinder the deployment of pre-trained point cloud recognition models trained on clean point clouds, leading to significant performance degradation. While test-time adaptation (TTA) strategies have shown promising results on this issue in the 2D domain, their application to 3D point clouds remains under-explored. Among TTA methods, an input adaptation approach, which directly converts test instances to the source domain using a pre-trained diffusion model, has been proposed in the 2D domain. Despite its robust TTA performance in practical situations, naively adopting this into the 3D domain may be suboptimal due to the neglect of inherent properties of point clouds, and its prohibitive computational cost. Motivated by these limitations, we propose CloudFixer, a test-time input adaptation method tailored for 3D point clouds, employing a pre-trained diffusion model. Specifically, CloudFixer optimizes geometric transformation parameters with carefully designed objectives that leverage the geometric properties of point clouds. We also substantially improve computational efficiency by avoiding backpropagation through the diffusion model and a prohibitive generation process. Furthermore, we propose an online model adaptation strategy by aligning the original model prediction with that of the adapted input. Extensive experiments showcase the superiority of CloudFixer over various TTA baselines, excelling in handling common corruptions and natural distribution shifts across diverse real-world scenarios.

To tackle this issue, an existing test-time adaptation (TTA) method has recently been proposed to adapt the pre-trained ASR model on unlabeled test instances without source data. Despite decent performance gain, this work relies solely on naive greedy decoding and performs adaptation across timesteps at a frame level, which may not be optimal given the sequential nature of the model output. Motivated by this, we propose a novel TTA framework, dubbed SGEM, for general ASR models. To treat the sequential output, SGEM first exploits beam search to explore candidate output logits and selects the most plausible one. Then, it utilizes generalized entropy minimization and negative sampling as unsupervised objectives to adapt the model. SGEM achieves state-of-the-art performance for three mainstream ASR models under various domain shifts.","tags":[],"title":"SGEM: Test-Time Adaptation for Automatic Speech Recognition via Sequential-Level Generalized Entropy Minimization","type":"publications"},{"authors":["Eunho Yang","Changhun Kim","Joonhyung Park","Hajin Shim"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1688342400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1688342400,"objectID":"cbb5e3cd3d1df6a5852d9df170562524","permalink":"https://drumpt.github.io/patents/sgem/","publishdate":"2023-07-03T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/patents/sgem/","section":"patents","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Test-Time Adaptation for Automatic Speech Recognition via Sequential-Level Generalized Entropy Minimization","type":"patents"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1684368e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1684368e3,"objectID":"648bd12381411e481f7f27f05ff7b526","permalink":"https://drumpt.github.io/news/sgem/","publishdate":"2023-05-18T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/news/sgem/","section":"news","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"One paper is accepted to INTERSPEECH 2023 as an oral presentation.","type":"news"},{"authors":["Changhun Kim","吳恩達"],"categories":["Demo","教程"],"content":"import libr print(\u0026#39;hello\u0026#39;) Overview The Wowchemy website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs.
